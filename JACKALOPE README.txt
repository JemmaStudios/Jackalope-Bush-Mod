== INFORMATION ==
This is the Jackalope Bush Mod for the X-Plane 11 Columbia 400

It represents several experimental modifications to the stock Columbia 400, making it it the perfect aircraft for law enforcement or executive backcountry operations.

== INSTRUCTIONS ==
Drop the Columbia 400 folder into your X-Plane 11/Aircraft/Extra Aircraft folder and replace files when asked.

== OTHER INFORMATION ==
This modification is offered as-is, may not work, or could completely destroy everything you love, especially if you do something wrong enough.  However, feel free to distribute to anyone you deem fit.

== CUSTOM LIVERIES ==
We also accept commissions for custom liveries for any FSX/P3D/XP11 aircraft we already own or have access to an open source paintkit.
